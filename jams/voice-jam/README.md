# Voice Jam - Ambient Sound

This Voice Jam explores how to use speech synthesis and speech recognition. Inspired by Wind Instrument, a work by Ã‰TIENNE PAQUETTE, the interaction plays into what what place we hold in the sound landscape that surrounds us. 

My practice in creative coding being relatively new, I've mostly on worked on making games. Using speech in games for me feels like a gimmick most of the time. The p5 speech library was a good opportunity to explore what creative coding looked like for in this interactive medium.
